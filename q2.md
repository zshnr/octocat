"Upstream remote" is establishes a relationship between a local branch and a remote branch. It its not a relationship between local and remote repos, per se, but between branches. The branches need not be the
same. A local development branch could track a remote master branch and vice versa. If a project has different local branches, those branches can be individually set to different remote branches.
