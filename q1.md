The command git clones creates a copy of a remote repository (one that does not reside on your computer), be it from a local network or the web, onto your computer and in doing so it creates a directory with
the same name as the remote repository. It clones all the branches in that repository and checksout the active branch (usually master). If I had to explain it in even simpler terms, I'd say git clone downloads
a remote repository onto the computer (creating a 1 for 1 copy of the remote repo).
